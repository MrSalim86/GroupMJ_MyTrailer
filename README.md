## ðŸ“œ Scenario Overview:
**MyTrailer** is a car trailer rental service that operates through partnerships with various locations (e.g., Jem og Fix, Fog), providing customers with short-term rental solutions. Our goal is to make the process of renting trailers as simple and convenient as possible through a mobile app. 

Customers can use the app to:
- Select a trailer from a specific location.
- Rent trailers for a maximum of 24 hours.
- Pay for additional services like insurance.
- Return trailers on time to avoid late fees.
- Book long-term, overnight rentals via a separate website.

- **Handle payments** for optional insurance and late return fees.
- **Maintain partnerships** with businesses providing space for trailer parking.
